# Phase 2: Multi-Relational Hypergraph Support

## Overview

Phase 2 of the OpenCog HypergraphQL Transformer implementation adds comprehensive support for multi-relational reasoning over typed hypergraph structures. This enables the model to distinguish between different types of relationships (e.g., "is-a", "part-of", "causes") and apply type-specific processing.

## Motivation

Real-world knowledge graphs contain diverse relationship types with different semantics:
- **Taxonomic relationships** (is-a): "Dog is-a Animal"
- **Compositional relationships** (part-of): "Wheel part-of Car"
- **Causal relationships** (causes): "Exercise causes Health"
- **Spatial relationships** (located-at): "Paris located-at France"
- **Temporal relationships** (before/after): "Breakfast before Lunch"

Phase 1 treated all edges uniformly. Phase 2 enables relation-type-aware processing.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. New Hyperparameters

```cpp
struct hypergraphql_hparams {
  // ... existing parameters ...
  int32_t n_relation_types = 16;  // number of relation types (NEW)
};
```

**Purpose**: Defines how many distinct relation types the model can represent.

**Default**: 16 relation types (configurable based on domain requirements)

### 2. Relation Type Embeddings

```cpp
struct hypergraphql_model {
  // ... existing embeddings ...
  struct ggml_tensor *relation_type_emb;  // [n_embd × n_relation_types]
};
```

**Purpose**: Learn distinct representations for each relation type. These embeddings are used to modulate attention and convolution operations based on the relationship type.

**Dimensions**: Each relation type has a d-dimensional embedding vector where d = n_embd

### 3. Enhanced Layer Structure

```cpp
struct hypergraphql_layer {
  // ... existing components ...
  
  // Relation-aware attention
  struct ggml_tensor *relation_attn_w;   // [n_embd × n_embd]
  struct ggml_tensor *relation_attn_b;   // [n_embd]
  
  // Relation-aware graph convolution
  struct ggml_tensor *relation_conv_w;   // [n_embd × n_embd]
  struct ggml_tensor *relation_conv_b;   // [n_embd]
};
```

**Purpose**: Each layer learns relation-specific transformations for attention and message passing.

## New Operations

### Relation-Aware Attention

**Function Signature:**
```cpp
ggml_tensor *relation_aware_attention(const hypergraphql_layer &layer,
                                     ggml_context *ctx0, 
                                     ggml_tensor *inp,
                                     ggml_tensor *relation_emb);
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Transform relation embeddings: `R' = W_r · R + b_r`
2. Compute attention weights considering relation types
3. Modulate attention output: `Output = Input ⊙ R'`

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
RelationAttention(X, R) = X ⊙ σ(W_r · R + b_r)
```

Where:
- `X`: Input features
- `R`: Relation type embeddings
- `W_r, b_r`: Learnable relation attention parameters
- `⊙`: Element-wise multiplication
- `σ`: Activation function

**Intuition**: Different relation types produce different attention patterns, allowing the model to focus on relevant features based on the relationship type.

### Relation-Aware Graph Convolution

**Function Signature:**
```cpp
ggml_tensor *relation_graph_convolution(const hypergraphql_layer &layer,
                                       ggml_context *ctx0, 
                                       ggml_tensor *inp,
                                       ggml_tensor *relation_emb);
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Compute base graph convolution: `H_base = W_conv · X + b_conv`
2. Transform relation embeddings: `R' = W_rel · R + b_rel`
3. Apply relation-specific modulation: `H_out = H_base ⊙ R'`

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
RelationConv(X, R) = (W_conv · X) ⊙ σ(W_rel · R + b_rel) + b_conv
```

**Intuition**: Message passing behavior differs based on edge type. For example:
- "is-a" relationships might propagate features upward in taxonomy
- "part-of" relationships might aggregate features from components
- "causes" relationships might emphasize temporal flow

## Integration in Forward Pass

### Modified Evaluation Pipeline

```cpp
bool hypergraphql_eval(...) {
  // 1. Standard embeddings
  struct ggml_tensor *inpL = ggml_get_rows(ctx0, model.wte, embd);
  inpL = ggml_add(ctx0, inpL, position_embeddings);
  
  // 2. Initialize relation embeddings (NEW)
  struct ggml_tensor *relation_indices = /* assign relation types */;
  struct ggml_tensor *relation_emb = 
      ggml_get_rows(ctx0, model.relation_type_emb, relation_indices);
  
  // 3. Process through layers
  for (int il = 0; il < n_layer; ++il) {
    // ... standard attention ...
    
    // Graph convolution with relation awareness (ENHANCED)
    cur = graph_convolution(model.layers[il], ctx0, inpFF);
    rel_conv = relation_graph_convolution(
        model.layers[il], ctx0, inpFF, relation_emb);
    cur = ggml_add(ctx0, cur, rel_conv);  // Combine both
    
    // ... rest of layer ...
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Relation indices can be provided as input or learned from context
- Both standard and relation-aware convolutions are computed and combined
- Maintains backward compatibility with Phase 1 models

## Relation Type Vocabulary

### Default Relation Types

The model supports a configurable vocabulary of relation types:

| ID | Relation Type | Description | Example |
|----|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | `is-a` | Taxonomic (inheritance) | Dog is-a Animal |
| 1 | `part-of` | Compositional (meronymy) | Wheel part-of Car |
| 2 | `causes` | Causal relationship | Heat causes Expansion |
| 3 | `located-at` | Spatial relationship | Paris located-at France |
| 4 | `temporal-before` | Temporal ordering | Sunrise temporal-before Sunset |
| 5 | `similar-to` | Similarity | Cat similar-to Dog |
| 6 | `opposite-of` | Antonym | Hot opposite-of Cold |
| 7 | `has-property` | Attribute relationship | Sky has-property Blue |
| 8 | `performs` | Action relationship | Bird performs Flying |
| 9 | `requires` | Dependency | Plant requires Water |
| 10-15 | `custom-*` | User-defined types | Domain-specific relations |

### Customizing Relation Types

Users can define custom relation vocabularies based on domain requirements:

```python
# Example: Scientific knowledge graph
relation_types = {
    0: "is-a",           # Taxonomy
    1: "part-of",        # Composition
    2: "reacts-with",    # Chemical reactions
    3: "produces",       # Reaction products
    4: "catalyzes",      # Catalytic relationships
    5: "inhibits",       # Inhibition
    6: "located-in",     # Cellular location
    7: "expressed-in",   # Gene expression
    # ... up to n_relation_types
}
```

## Training Considerations

### Loss Functions

Multi-relational training benefits from:

1. **Standard Language Modeling Loss:**
   ```
   L_lm = -∑ log P(w_i | w_<i, G, R)
   ```

2. **Relation Type Prediction Loss:**
   ```
   L_rel = -∑ log P(r_ij | v_i, v_j, context)
   ```

3. **Graph Structure Preservation Loss:**
   ```
   L_struct = ∑ ||emb(v_i) - AGG({emb(v_j) : (v_i, r, v_j) ∈ E_r})||²
   ```

**Total Loss:**
```
L_total = λ_lm · L_lm + λ_rel · L_rel + λ_struct · L_struct
```

### Data Format

Training data should include relation type annotations:

```json
{
  "text": "Dogs are animals that bark.",
  "hypergraph": {
    "nodes": [
      {"id": 0, "text": "Dogs"},
      {"id": 1, "text": "animals"},
      {"id": 2, "text": "bark"}
    ],
    "edges": [
      {"source": 0, "target": 1, "relation": "is-a"},
      {"source": 0, "target": 2, "relation": "performs"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from ctransformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load Phase 2 model
llm = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "path/to/hypergraphql-phase2.bin",
    model_type="hypergraphql"
)

# Query with relation type awareness
query = """
Using 'is-a' and 'part-of' relations:
What is the relationship between neurons and the brain?
"""
response = llm(query, max_new_tokens=150)
print(response)
```

### Advanced: Multi-Hop Reasoning

```python
# Multi-hop reasoning with relation types
query = """
Given:
- Neuron is-a Cell
- Cell part-of Tissue
- Tissue part-of Organ
- Brain is-a Organ

Query: What is the relationship between Neuron and Brain?
"""
response = llm(query, max_new_tokens=200)
# Expected: Multi-hop reasoning through typed relations
```

### Causal Reasoning

```python
# Causal chain reasoning
query = """
Using 'causes' relations:
- Exercise causes Increased Metabolism
- Increased Metabolism causes Weight Loss
- Weight Loss causes Improved Health

Query: What is the causal chain from Exercise to Improved Health?
"""
response = llm(query, max_new_tokens=150)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Overhead

Phase 2 adds the following memory requirements:

- **Relation Type Embeddings**: `n_relation_types × n_embd × sizeof(float)`
  - Example: 16 × 768 × 4 = ~49 KB
  
- **Per-Layer Relation Weights**: `2 × (n_embd² + n_embd) × sizeof(float) × n_layer`
  - Example: 2 × (768² + 768) × 4 × 12 = ~56 MB

**Total Overhead**: Approximately 56 MB for default configuration (negligible compared to base model)

### Computational Overhead

- Relation-aware operations add ~10-15% compute overhead per layer
- Can be optimized with fused operations
- Future work: CUDA/Metal kernels for relation-specific operations

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Static Relation Assignment**: Relation types are currently assigned at initialization, not dynamically inferred from context
2. **Fixed Relation Vocabulary**: Number of relation types must be specified at model creation
3. **Uniform Relation Weighting**: All relation types equally weighted in loss function

### Phase 3 Roadmap

1. **Dynamic Relation Inference**: Learn to infer relation types from context
2. **Hierarchical Relations**: Support relation type hierarchies (e.g., "is-a" subsumes "is-instance-of")
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Track relation changes over time
4. **OpenCog AtomSpace Integration**: Direct integration with OpenCog knowledge representation
5. **Scalability**: Optimized kernels for large-scale graphs

## Validation and Testing

### Unit Tests

```python
# Test relation type support
def test_relation_types():
    assert model.supports_relation_types()
    assert model.n_relation_types == 16

# Test relation-aware attention
def test_relation_attention():
    # Verify attention differs for different relation types
    attention_isa = compute_attention(input, relation_type="is-a")
    attention_partof = compute_attention(input, relation_type="part-of")
    assert not torch.equal(attention_isa, attention_partof)
```

### Integration Tests

```python
# Test multi-relational query
def test_multihop_reasoning():
    query = "A is-a B. B part-of C. What relates A to C?"
    response = llm(query)
    assert "is-a" in response and "part-of" in response
```
